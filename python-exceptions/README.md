# Python - Exceptions

This project is part of the Holberton School Higher Level Programming curriculum.  
It focuses on understanding and handling exceptions in Python using `try`, `except`,
`else`, `finally`, and `raise`.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, I am able to explain:

- What exceptions are and why they are used
- The difference between errors and exceptions
- How to correctly use `try` / `except`
- How to handle multiple exceptions
- When and how to raise exceptions
- How to clean up code using `finally`

## Requirements

- Python 3
- No external modules allowed unless explicitly stated
- Code must follow `pycodestyle` (version 2.8.*)
- All files must be executable
- All files must start with `#!/usr/bin/python3`

## Files

| File | Description |
|------|------------|
| `0-safe_print_list.py` | Prints x elements of a list safely |
| `1-safe_print_integer.py` | Prints an integer safely |
| `2-safe_print_list_integers.py` | Prints integers from a list safely |
| `3-safe_print_division.py` | Divides two numbers with exception handling |
| `4-list_division.py` | Divides elements of two lists |
| `5-raise_exception.py` | Raises a `TypeError` exception |
| `6-raise_exception_msg.py` | Raises a `NameError` with a message |
