# Python - Test Driven Development

This project is part of the Holberton School Higher Level Programming curriculum.
It focuses on Test Driven Development (TDD) using Python.

In this project, functions are written and validated using doctests and unittests
before and during implementation to ensure correctness and robustness.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, I am able to explain:

- What Test Driven Development (TDD) is
- Why tests are important in software development
- How to write doctests in Python
- How to write unit tests using the unittest module
- How to validate edge cases and error handling
- How to follow strict project specifications

## Requirements

- Python 3
- All files must start with `#!/usr/bin/python3`
- No external modules allowed unless explicitly stated
- Code must follow `pycodestyle` (version 2.8.*)
- All test files must be inside the `tests/` directory
- All files must be executable
